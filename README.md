# SaveFreak
Insanely backups your game save files

Primarly created for game Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. It's save system is incredibly limited (only 1 save file!) thus making a hard time for even expierenced players avoid mistakes and some mistakes can cost you much like missing zones, important items, important NPCs and so on. But no more! With this little script you are not afraid of making crucial mistakes anymore and you even can experiment and try new risky things!

# How does it work?
It watches for one save file changes. When you save a game script sees that and makes a copy of that file with unique name. Name consists of timestamp and is put into separate directory with a name of current date. There is no limit of files, you are always safe! If you want to restore to some save file just locate it and replace main save file with it.
